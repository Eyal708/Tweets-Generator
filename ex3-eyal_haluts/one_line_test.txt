this is not the greatest song in the world.
this is just a tribute#
couldn't remember the greatest. song in the world.
no, this is tribute.
you do it to yourself, you do, and that's. what really hurts.
you do it to yourself, just you, you and no. one else.
you know it's true, you have a magic touch, you are my sunshine.
